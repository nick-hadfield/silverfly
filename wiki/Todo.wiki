=Items that need looking at (in rough order of priority)=

  * Update copyright/versioning in `AssemblyInfo`.
  * Create a redistributable.
  * Split example into two examples, one for animals/shapes, and one to demonstrate Marshall(). Tidy up in general.
  * Look at differences between `Action<object, TNotification>` and `EventHandler<TEventArgs>`.
  * Look at creating an example to handle a scenario similar to the one mentioned by Udi in his MSDN article on domain driven design (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/magazine/ee321567.aspx).
